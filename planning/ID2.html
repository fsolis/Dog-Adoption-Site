    <h2>Step 1 </h2>

<p>Create the tables needed to hold the information necessary for the adoption center. When the tables have been created, the data that belongs to each table will be filled. There will be tables for workers, clients, available dogs, breeds, adopted dogs. </p> 

<h2>Step 2</h2>

<p>Once the tables have been created, the appropriate web pages will be created. This means having a homepage, a page that will display available dogs, adopted dogs, workers, and a few pages that will run certain table displays. </p>

<h2>Step 3</h2>

<p>Once the pages are created, the functionality will be added to them. They will be able to make queries to a database and be able to update the information depending on what the functionality of the web page is.</p>

<h2>Step 4</h2>

<p>Once each page is working properly, the final integration between pages will be made. Information will be passed between pages so that the user can have a seamless experience. Once they are done they will be able to log out of the page so that another person will be able to log in. </p>
