      <h2>Project Description</h2>

	<p>The website that will be created will be SPCA type website where anyone can go to find their perfect dog. This website will have many categories of Dogs that will help the wold be adopters find the perfect match for them. Usually when someone is looking for a dog, it is a hard process to find a type of dog they are looking for. Sometimes people are breed specific, other times they care about the type of social behaviors they want. This can be hard because when someone goes to a dog rescue or a pound, there is not way of knowing what type of dogs are there or how the dogs behave.  This causes the people to go to the pounds multiple times without knowing what might be there or if the dog is a perfect match. </p>


	<h2>Target Audience</h2>

	<p>This website is aimed at individuals who might want to adopt a dog and would like to cut out the time it takes to find viable options. Also this website is being made to help the dog rescue center be able to keep track of their staff, dogs, and clients. This will help alleviate the amount of time it takes to process  an adoption. </p>

	<h2>Scope</h2>

	<p>For this project we will assume that an adoption center has about 4 managers, 4 full time employees, and about 10 volunteers. Only managers and full time employees can modify tables, however volunteers also have the ability to update certain elements of a record. We will assume that a dog center will have approximately 30 dogs in the center. Whenever a dog is adopted, another will be placed in the center. </p>
